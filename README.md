Web Data Mining to Detect Online Spread of Terrorism

Overview:=
The Web Data Mining to Detect Online Spread of Terrorism project is a web-based application designed to identify potentially harmful or extremist content online. By leveraging web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this tool helps analyze textual data from various sources and assess its risk level. The aim is to assist in monitoring and mitigating the spread of extremist ideology online.


Key Features:=
Flexible Data Input: Users can input data through URLs, direct text input, or by uploading text files.
Web Scraping: Utilizes BeautifulSoup to extract content from web pages for detailed analysis.
Text Preprocessing: Applies NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization to prepare the text for analysis.
Analysis with ANN: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras processes the preprocessed data and assigns a risk score to indicate the likelihood of extremist content.
Results Display: Presents analysis results in a clear format, highlighting key phrases and providing an overall risk score.


Technology Stack:=
Backend: Python, Flask
Frontend: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup
NLP Libraries: NLTK
Machine Learning Framework: Keras


How It Works:=
Input Stage: Users provide content for analysis via different input methods.
Scraping & Preprocessing: Extracted text is cleaned and standardized using NLP techniques.
Model Processing: The data is passed through the ANN model, which evaluates the content and outputs a risk score.
Output Stage: Results are displayed with highlighted keywords and an overall threat level assessment.


Challenges and Solutions:=
Model Accuracy: To reduce false positives, the model was fine-tuned with a more diverse dataset and optimized through parameter adjustments.
Data Handling: Ensuring varied input sources required effective data extraction and preprocessing strategies.


Future Enhancements:=
Expanding to support multiple languages for broader analysis.
Improving the response time of the application.
Implementing advanced data visualization tools for better insights.


Conclusion:=
This project demonstrates the power of web data mining combined with machine learning to support the detection of potentially harmful online content. It showcases my expertise in developing robust web applications with a focus on practical, real-world applications.
